        <h2>I am an aspiring Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) specialist with a strong foundation in Computer Science,
             Mathematics, and Philosophy. My long-term goal is to design intelligent systems that solve real-world problems in education, 
             healthcare, and finance. I am passionate about building innovative solutions that combine logical thinking, data-driven insights,
              and cutting-edge AI techniques.
</h2> <!--About me-->
        <p>My name is Edosa Enohuean Collins, a Computer Science undergraduate at the National Open University of Nigeria (NOUN), 
            expected to graduate in 2027. I have a deep interest in mathematics, programming, and artificial intelligence, 
            and I’m actively building the skills and projects that will shape me into a professional AI researcher and developer.
             Beyond coding, I’m passionate about teaching, problem-solving, and motivating others through knowledge.</p> <!--Your bio here..-->

            </ul><!--Project 1-->
            <p>I’m a Computer Science student working towards becoming an AI/ML expert. My portfolio is a reflection of my growth as a developer,
                 researcher, and problem-solver. I believe that knowledge is best understood through analogies and
                  I constantly apply that principle in my learning and teaching. My focus is on building projects, 
                  collaborations, and research ideas that will prepare me for postgraduate studies and a career in Artificial Intelligence.
